## Test the Improvements

### 1. Run Tests
```bash
# Install new dependencies first
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
make test
# or
pytest tests/ -v

# Expected: 60+ tests passing
```

### 2. Check Production Readiness
```bash
make prod-check
```

### 3. Verify Docker Build
```bash
# Build the updated image
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq
```

### 4. Test New Features

**Test Pagination:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer coffee-addict-secret-key-2025" \
  "http://localhost:8000/coffee/?limit=5&offset=0"
```

**Test Enhanced Health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq
```

**Test Configurable Limits:**
```bash
# Should work (within default 1000mg limit)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer coffee-addict-secret-key-2025" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8000/coffee/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"caffeine_mg": 500}'
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Review the new documentation:
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md` - for local setup
   - `SECURITY.md` - for security practices
   - `MIGRATIONS.md` - for database changes
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - for version history

2. Run the tests to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. Check production readiness:
   ```bash
   make prod-check
   ```

### Before Production Deployment
1. Change the default API key in `.env`
2. Configure CORS origins for your domain
3. Set up HTTPS with reverse proxy
4. Review SECURITY.md checklist
5. Set up monitoring and alerting
6. Configure automated backups

### Optional Enhancements (Future)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Implement JWT for multi-user support
- Add data export functionality
- Set up log aggregation
- Add audit logging
- Implement API versioning

## Docker Image Note

The remaining Docker vulnerability (1 high) in the Python 3.12-alpine base image is a known issue with the alpine distribution. Options to address:

### Option 1: Accept the Risk (Recommended)
The vulnerability is in the base OS layer and doesn't directly affect the Python application. Alpine regularly updates, and this is acceptable for most use cases.

### Option 2: Use Debian Slim
Replace in Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Remove alpine-specific packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    curl \
    libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Option 3: Use Distroless
For maximum security (more complex):
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim as builder
# Build dependencies
# ...

FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12
COPY --from=builder /app /app
# No shell, minimal attack surface
```

For this project, **Option 1 is recommended** as the vulnerability is minimal and the Alpine image provides the best balance of size, security, and compatibility.
